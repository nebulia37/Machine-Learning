# Setting up your Python environment on a local machine

The demos and labs in the class will invoke Python through the powerful [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html) interface.
Jupyter notebook is a web-based application that lets you create and edit documents with live Python code, rich comments, and images.
The demos and labs will also make extensive use of the [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) libraries, which are built on the [NumPy](https://numpy.org), [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org), and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) libraries.
Later in the course, we will use [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) to implement neural networks.
(PyTorch is similar to TensorFlow, but is newer and has

[advantages](https://towardsdatascience.com/pytorch-vs-tensorflow-in-code-ada936fd5406).)

Using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download),
you can install a complete Python environment, including Jupyter notebook, scikit-learn, and PyTorch, on your local (Windows,Mac,Linux) machine.
Make sure you install Python 3 (_not_ Python 2)!
