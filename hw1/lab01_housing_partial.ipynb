    "Finally, we will compute the $R^2$ values for all floating-point features in the dataset and print the values in a table. Your table should look like the following, where each the first column is the feature name and the second column is the $R^2$ value.\n",

    "\n",
    "Only consider the features with datatype `float64`.  (We'll learn how to handle \"categorical\" data in the next unit.) You can check the datatype of a feature using the `df.dtypes` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, some features have a few missing data entries that you will need to omit.  By default, pandas codes the missing data as NaN, and so if you don't omit the missing data your $R^2$ values will also be NaN.  Check for the presence/absence of NaNs using either `df.notna()` in pandas or `np.isnan()` in numpy, and then compute the linear fit on the non-NaN data for each feature.  You can do the last part by constructing an array of logical values `i_valid` and then extracting the valid datapoints via `x[i_valid]` and `y[i_valid]`."
